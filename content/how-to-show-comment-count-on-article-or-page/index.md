In this modern day, user engagement is very important and you can improve it if you show comment count on your article or page.

You can easily display comment count without adding any additional API calls on the page â€“ simply add following HTML Data Attribute in the comment count anchor tag:

`<a data="vuukle-count" href="#vuukle-comments">comments</a>`

Also the count can be displayed with even more handy form:

`<a href="#"><span data="vuukle-count" data-empty-text="Add a">0</span> Comments</a>`
